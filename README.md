### Downloading TCGA dataset on easy-way and cropping image from .svs files.

I recommand you to this progress to check the codes:
* clinical_csv_maker.ipynb
* downloader.py
* cropping_TCGA.py

required library:
* openslide
* openslide-python
* opencv-python

  This code is optimized in Linux, so if there is any error while downloading the svs file,

  adjust the download.py codes for your each projects.
