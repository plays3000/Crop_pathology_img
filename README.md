### Downloading TCGA dataset on easy-way and cropping image from .svs files.

I recommand you to this progress to check the codes:
* clinical_csv_maker.ipynb
  
* downloader.py
  
* cropping_TCGA.py

required library:
* openslide
* openslide-python
* opencv-python

  This code is optimized for Linux, so if there is any error while downloading the svs file,
  adjust the download.py and cropping_TCGA.py codes for your projects.
